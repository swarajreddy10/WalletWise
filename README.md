*Finance should not just be tracked — it should be understood.*

## 📖 Overview

WalletWise is a next-generation personal finance platform designed to **teach, guide, and protect** users—especially students and young professionals—from poor financial decisions.

Unlike traditional finance apps that merely record transactions, WalletWise **actively interprets behaviour**, **predicts future obligations**, and **assists users in making smarter financial decisions** in real time.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy

> **Finance should not just be tracked — it should be understood.**

WalletWise transforms raw financial data into actionable intelligence, helping users develop lasting financial literacy and discipline.

---

## 🚀 Why WalletWise Exists

Most financial tools fail at one crucial point:

> **They tell users what they spent, but never *why* — and never *what to do next*.**

### The WalletWise Difference

WalletWise closes this gap by combining:

- ✅ **Structured financial tracking**
- 📊 **Predictive planning**
- 🧠 **Behavioural analysis**
- 🤖 **Decision intelligence**

This results in a system that **educates users financially**, not just records data.

---

## 🧠 Design Principle: Behaviour-Aware Finance

WalletWise is built around the concept of **Behaviour-Aware Finance**, where financial data is:

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 📥 **Tracked** | Capture all transactions |
| 📂 **Structured** | Organize into categories & budgets |
| 🔮 **Predicted** | Anticipate future obligations |
| 🔍 **Interpreted** | Analyze behaviour patterns |
| 💡 **Advised upon** | Provide real-time decision support |

**Result:** Financial awareness, not financial anxiety.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

WalletWise follows a **layered functional architecture**, where each layer builds meaningfully on the previous one:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Decision Intelligence │  ← AI-powered spending advisor
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Behaviour Analysis    │  ← Pattern detection & insights
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Future Planning       │  ← Predictive budgeting
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Budget Control        │  ← Proactive spending limits
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Data Collection       │  ← Transaction foundation
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Architecture Benefits

- ✅ **Logical scalability** — Add features without breaking existing functionality
- ✅ **Clear separation of concerns** — Each layer has a distinct purpose
- ✅ **Smooth learning curve** — Users progress naturally from basic to advanced features

**Due-Date-Driven Savings Logic**

The system calculates:

- 💰 **Required daily/weekly savings** to meet the goal
- 📈 **Savings progress** tracking

**Savings Readiness Indicator**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ **On track** | Savings are sufficient |
| ⚠️ **Lagging** | Need to accelerate savings |

---

### 4️⃣ Behaviour Awareness & Finance Intelligence
**AI-Driven Insight Layer**

#### 🎯 Purpose
To explain the **root causes** of financial instability — not just visualize them.

#### ✨ Features

**AI Behaviour Diagnostics**

The system detects:
- 💸 **Overspending patterns** (which categories, when, why)

- 😢 **Emotional/impulsive spending** (correlation with mood/stress)

**Insight-Based Feedback**

Example insights:
- *"Weekend food spending spikes consistently by 40%."*
- *"Impulse purchases increase after budget exhaustion."*
- *"Entertainment expenses triple during exam weeks."*

**Root Cause Analysis**

Converts charts into **human-readable explanations**:
- Why did you overspend this month?
- What triggers your impulse purchases?
- Which days of the week are financially riskiest?

#### 🧩 Why It Matters

> Users often know **what** they spend — but not **why**.

Understanding behaviour is the key to **sustainable financial improvement**.

---

### 5️⃣ Decision Helper
**Real-Time Spending Advisor**

#### 🎯 Purpose
To act as a **financial checkpoint** before a purchase is made.

#### 🔍 Decision Inputs

**The system evaluates:**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| 💵 **Purchase cost** | How much you want to spend |
| 😊 **User's emotional state** | Happy, stressed, impulsive, calm |
| 📊 **Current monthly budget status** | Remaining budget & category limits |
| 💰 **Available savings** | Emergency funds & goal savings |
| 📅 **Upcoming obligations** | Pending bills, events, dues |

#### ✅ Decision Output

**Clear recommendation:**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✔️ **Affordable** | Go ahead, purchase aligns with budget |
| ⚠️ **Risky** | Proceed with caution, may impact goals |
| ❌ **Not Recommended** | High risk, likely to cause financial stress |

**Reasoned explanation:**
- Not just *yes/no*, but **why**
- Specific impact on budget and goals
- Alternative suggestions when applicable

#### 🧩 Why It Matters
